    NextGenPSD2 XS2A Framework

    # Summary **Open Payments Europe NextGenPSD2 API** definition is based on The Berlin Group NextGenPSD2 Framework with some additional services like the ASPSP Information Services. The **NextGenPSD2** *Framework Version 1.3.3* offers a modern, open, harmonised and interoperable set of  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the safest and most efficient way to provide data securely.  The NextGenPSD2 Framework reduces XS2A complexity and costs, addresses the problem of multiple competing standards  in Europe and, aligned with the goals of the Euro Retail Payments Board, enables European banking customers to benefit from innovative products and services ('Banking as a Service')  by granting TPPs safe and secure (authenticated and authorised) access to their bank accounts and financial data.  The possible Approaches are:   * Redirect SCA Approach   * OAuth SCA Approach   * Decoupled SCA Approach   * Embedded SCA Approach without SCA method   * Embedded SCA Approach with only one SCA method available   * Embedded SCA Approach with Selection of a SCA method    Not every message defined in this API definition is necessary for all approaches.    Furthermore this API definition does not differ between methods which are mandatory, conditional, or optional  ## Some General Remarks Related to this version of the OpenAPI Specification: * **This API definition is based on the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API.**    It is not an replacement in any sense.   The main specification is (at the moment) always the Implementation Guidelines of the Berlin Group PSD2 API. * **This API definition contains the REST-API for requests from the PISP to the ASPSP.** * **This API definition contains the messages for all different approaches defined in the Implementation Guidelines.** * According to the OpenAPI-Specification [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md]        \"If in is \"header\" and the name field is \"Accept\", \"Content-Type\" or \"Authorization\", the parameter definition SHALL be ignored.\"      The element \"Accept\" will not be defined in this file at any place.      The elements \"Content-Type\" and \"Authorization\" are implicitly defined by the OpenApi tags \"content\" and \"security\".    * There are several predefined types which might occur in payment initiation messages,    but are not used in the standard JSON messages in the Implementation Guidelines.   Therefore they are not used in the corresponding messages in this file either.   We added them for the convenience of the user.   If there is a payment product, which need these field, one can easily use the predefined types.   But the ASPSP need not to accept them in general.    * **We omit the definition of all standard HTTP header elements (mandatory/optional/conditional)    except they are mention in the Implementation Guidelines.**   Therefore the implementer might add the in his own realisation of a PSD2 comlient API in addition to the elements define in this file.     ## General Remarks on Data Types  The Berlin Group definition of UTF-8 strings in context of the PSD2 API have to support at least the following characters  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  / - ? : ( ) . , ' +  # Authentication  <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->  # noqa: E501

        This method create a consent resource, defining access rights to dedicated accounts of  a given PSU-ID.

Optional Extension: As an option, an ASPSP might optionally accept a specific access right on the access on all psd2 related services for all available accounts.   As another option an ASPSP might optionally also accept a command, where only access rights are inserted without mentioning the addressed account.  The relation to accounts is then handled afterwards between PSU and ASPSP.  This option is not supported for the Embedded SCA Approach.  As a last option, an ASPSP might in addition accept a command with access rights   * to see the list of available payment accounts or   * to see the list of available payment accounts with balances.   # noqa: E501

        :param str x_affiliated_aspsp_id: The ID of an affiliated ASPSP as related to the X-BicFi header 
        :param str digest: Is contained if and only if the \"Signature\" element is contained in the header of the request.
        :param str signature: A signature of the request by the TPP on application level. This might be mandated by ASPSP. 
        :param str tpp_signature_certificate: The certificate used for signing the request, in base64 encoding.  Must be contained if a signature is contained.

The ASPSP will then choose between the Embedded or the Decoupled SCA approach, depending on the choice of the SCA procedure by the TPP/PSU. If the parameter is not used, the ASPSP will choose the SCA approach to be applied depending on the SCA method chosen by the TPP/PSU.

Mandated for the Redirect SCA Approach, specifically  when TPP-Redirect-Preferred equals \"true\". It is recommended to always use this header field.  **Remark for Future:**  This field might be changed to mandatory in the next version of the specification. 
        :param str tpp_nok_redirect_uri: If this URI is contained, the TPP is asking to redirect the transaction flow to this address instead of the TPP-Redirect-URI in case of a negative result of the redirect SCA method. This might be ignored by the ASPSP. 
        :param str tpp_explicit_authorisation_preferred: If it equals \"true\", the TPP prefers to start the authorisation process separately,  e.g. because of the usage of a signing basket.  This preference might be ignored by the ASPSP, if a signing basket is not supported as functionality.  If it equals \"false\" or if the parameter is not used, there is no preference of the TPP.  This especially indicates that the TPP assumes a direct authorisation of the transaction in the next step,  without using a signing basket.

The usage of the constants supports the of following semantics:    SCA: A notification on every change of the scaStatus attribute for all related authorisation processes is preferred by the TPP.    PROCESS: A notification on all changes of consentStatus or transactionStatus attributes is preferred by the TPP.   LAST: Only a notification on the last consentStatus or transactionStatus as available in the XS2A interface is preferred by the TPP.  This header field may be ignored, if the ASPSP does not support resource notification services for the related TPP.

        This method update PSU data on the consents  resource if needed.  It may authorise a consent within the Embedded SCA Approach where needed.  Independently from the SCA Approach it supports e.g. the selection of  the authentication method and a non-SCA PSU authentication.  This methods updates PSU data on the cancellation authorisation resource if needed.   There are several possible Update PSU Data requests in the context of a consent request if needed,  which depends on the SCA approach:  * Redirect SCA Approach:   A specific Update PSU Data Request is applicable for      * the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach. * Decoupled SCA Approach:   A specific Update PSU Data Request is only applicable for   * adding the PSU Identification, if not provided yet in the Payment Initiation Request or the Account Information Consent Request, or if no OAuth2 access token is used, or   * the selection of authentication methods. * Embedded SCA Approach:    The Update PSU Data Request might be used    * to add credentials as a first factor authentication data of the PSU and   * to select the authentication method and   * transaction authorisation.  The SCA Approach might depend on the chosen SCA method.  For that reason, the following possible Update PSU Data request can apply to all SCA approaches:  * Select an SCA method in case of several SCA methods are available for the customer.
